# PLAGENOR Cloning Primer Designer

## Overview

PLAGENOR Cloning Primer Designer is a graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to assist molecular biologists in designing primers for cloning experiments. The software allows users to input ordinary forward and reverse primers, select restriction enzymes, and generate primers suitable for cloning.

## Features

- **User-friendly interface** built with Tkinter
- **Automatic prefix addition** for cloning compatibility
- **Enzyme selection** from a predefined list
- **Tm calculation** based on primer sequence and concentration
- **Clipboard operations** (Copy/Paste)
- **File operations** (Open, Save)
- **Clear all fields** function
- **Error handling** with message dialogs

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (included in standard Python distributions)

## Installation

### Running from Source
1. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
2. Clone or download the repository.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Run the script using:
   ```sh
   python primer_designer.py
   ```

### Running the Executable
1. Download `PLAGENOR_Primer_Designer.exe`.
2. Double-click the executable file to launch the application.
3. No additional dependencies are required.

## Usage

1. Enter the forward and reverse primers.
2. Select the appropriate restriction enzymes.
3. Adjust the primer concentration if necessary.
4. Click the **Generate Primers** button to create cloning-ready sequences.
5. Copy the results or save them to a file.
